Search Moorestown, NJ Newspaper Indexes - Mysql and PhP.  This is the
code I hope will be deployed at http://www.moorestown.lib.nj.us/ .
Current test data includes only a subset of the indexed years for the
News Chronicle.  Eventually we'll have more data for that paper and also
data for the Moorestown News, the Newsweekly, and the Moorestown Sun.

## TODO

- check for term length
- check for english lead article sorting library in php
- add checkboxes for newspapers with News Chronicle and Moorestown Sun checked by default
- add mustache for list output, no columns and search page widget for it on entry page
- validate date format (iso 8601 YYYY-MM-DD)
- add spage column to table
